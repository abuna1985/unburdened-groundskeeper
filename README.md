# Unburdened GroundsKeeper

> A local-first, high-visibility digital clipboard for independent trades. Built with Astro, Dexie, and Nano Stores to ensure zero latency, full data ownership, and no subscription lock-in. #BuiltToLastDev

## The Problem (The "Hell")

Small trade businesses (Landscapers, Plumbers) are drowning in "Sunday Admin."

- Lost revenue from forgotten jobs.
- Data trapped in expensive, complex SaaS tools.
- Interfaces that are invisible in direct sunlight.

## The Solution

A "Digital Power Tool" that lives on the phone.

- **Local-First:** Works offline. 0ms latency.
- **High Contrast:** "Industrial" style UI for outdoor visibility.
- **Ownership:** Data lives on the device (IndexedDB). Export anytime.

## The Stack (Unburdened)

- **Framework:** Astro + React (Islands Architecture)
- **State:** Nano Stores (Decoupled Logic)
- **Vault:** Dexie.js (IndexedDB Wrapper)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility First)
